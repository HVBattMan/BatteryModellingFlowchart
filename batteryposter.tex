%Electrochemical and equivalent-circuit modelling are the two most popular approaches to battery simulation, but the former is computationally expensive and the latter provides limited physical insight. A theoretical middle ground would be useful to support battery management, on-line diagnostics, and cell design. Through asymptotic analysis we can systematically derive simplified models which have their roots in physics-based models, but offer reduced computational complexity. Combinations of simplifications to the {\macrotext{macroscale}}  and {\microtext{microscale}} result in a suite of reduced-order models, whose complexity and fidelity can be selected to best meet the user's needs. The approach taken presents a general framework for developing reduced-order models which is independent of chemistry, and can be extended to incorporate additional physical effects such as mechanics, side reactions and degredation mechanisms. We are currently developing the software package PyBaMM, in collaboration with the Faraday Institution, which numerically implements the suite of models which lie within the common modelling framework.
